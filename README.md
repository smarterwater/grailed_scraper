# grailed_scraper

An application made to scrape the men's fashion marketplace Grailed. Made to increase my productivity - instead of spending hours looking for deals on cool clothes, I made a program that will do it for me.

Users can set the program up by entering the brand to search for, their clothing sizes, as well as their price limit, which will all be stored into a local .json file.
